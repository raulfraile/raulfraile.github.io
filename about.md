Hello! My name is Raul Fraile and I live in Alicante – Spain.

I am a passionate developer, currently focused on PHP and Symfony2. Also interested in performance and all the foundations of computer science, like data structures, algorithms, information theory and data compression.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [ServerGrove](http://servergrove.com) and run the [AlicantePHP User Group](http://alicantephp.es).

### Education

I graduated with honors in Computer Science, back in 2007. Then I got a University Expert Degree in Health informatics and now I am studying a Master’s degree in Computer Technologies. I am also a PHP 5.3 Zend Certified Engineer and SensioLabs Certified Symfony Developer (Expert level).
